<strong>---NEW Video Language Learning without Pain (helps you "not" look at subtitles)---</strong>
----Overview----

<strong>
<ul>
<li>You put 'mkv' files, it will output timestamps instructions to Anki/mpv and it will be played in the right order, (not red cards)</li>

<li>It will be similar to rewatching your shows, but it skips easy stuff and focuses on your weaknesses, so no "valuable" time is used on sentence mining, instead immersing more, the addon will do the rest.</li>

<li>There is Only "one side to the cards", The user watches and the Addon will automatically grade cards as good or bad based on "whether they have seen subtitles." so you won't see the sub if you are Confident enought that you understand (which is good)</li>
</ul></strong>

<strong>Features:</strong>

<strong>MPV Playing Functionality</strong>

Binge-Studying's MPV functionality allows for an uninterrupted, enjoyable watching experience. The addon detects timestamps and plays selected speech sections from the beginning, making language learning easy and effortless.

<strong>---Timestamps and Subtitles---</strong>

Binge-Studying simplifies language learning by gathering timestamps and subtitles from "mkv" files in a folder of your choice. It then creates a txt file for easy Anki deck creation. The addon's watching MPV functionality makes for a smooth learning experience.

<strong>Custom Shortcuts---</strong>
<strong>Navigation</strong>
Binge-Studying comes with custom shortcuts that you can use for easy grading:
<ul>
  <li><strong>C &amp; Up:</strong> Play timestamp without subtitles</li>
  <li><strong>X &amp; Down:</strong> Play timestamp with subtitles</li>
  <li><strong>Z &amp; Left:</strong> Undo</li>
  <li><strong>V &amp; Right:</strong> Grade the card as again or good based on if you showed the subtitles or not</li>
  <li><strong>D &amp; Esc:</strong> Get OUUt</li>
  <li><strong>B &amp; /:</strong> Delete Card</li>
</ul>
NOTE: that when the card is new, whether you saw the subtitles or not, it is graded as good.
<strong>Timestamp Editing</strong>
If there is not synced or chopped speech, Binge-Studying has timestamp editing features that let you manually edit the timestamps:
<ul>
  <li><strong>, :</strong> Set timestamp back 100ms at the start-position</li>
  <li><strong>. :</strong> Set timestamp forward 100ms at the start-position</li>
  <li><strong>[ :</strong> Set timestamp back 100ms at the end-position</li>
  <li><strong>] :</strong> Set timestamp forward 100ms at the end-position</li>
</ul>
